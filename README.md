# Formik React Library
* Formik takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff—keeping track of values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission—so you don't have to. This means you spend less time wiring up state and change handlers and more time focusing on your business logic.

1. Setting up the application
``` bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/techcorpian/formik-app.git
cd formik-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can access the running port and see the live application.
